### Description: This game mimics the functionality of the famous Red-Light Green-Light game: In our setup, we start from one corner of the matrix and must reach the other while following the defined path. Movement is only possible when the green light is on. If the player moves while the red light is on, the game is over.
### How it works: When powering on the LCD displays an introductory message until the joystick button is pressed. Afterward, we can observe on the menu its initial state: Start Game. We can navigate through the menu using the joystick with options such as Start Game, Highscore, Settings, and About. 
### The Start Game : option initiates our game on the matrix. 
### The Highscore option :  displays the best game time. 
### The Settings option : controls the game sound manually. We can set whether we want the game to have sounds or not. 
### The About option shows the game's creator.
